# Predicting Airfare on New Routes 
First Step : We have to partition the original dataset into training(60%) and validation sets(40%) .The model will be fit to the training data and evaluated on the validation set
Linear regression model
Fare = -23.95 + 7.04*COUPON – 1.80*NEW + 0.01*HI + 0.01*S_INCOME + 0.00*E_INCOME + 0.00*S_POP + 0.00*E_POP + 0.07*DISTANCE – 0.00*PAX – 33.71*VACATION_YES – 39.39*SW_YES + 19.16*SLOT_CTRL + 22.93*GATE_CONS

# Prediction on mile
If other variables are held constant (all else being equal), one mile increase in distance increases fare by $0.07 on average.

# Prediction on a flight run by SouthWest 
If other variables are held constant (all else being equal), a flight run by Southwest Airlines is $39.39 cheaper than other airlines on average
